Bus Stop Spacing Analysis and Optimization performs optimization of stop locations on a single Transit Route.
Given three spatial datasets, Stops by trip or period demand and travel time, Street network for access to stiops 
and origin / destination parcel or block locations, the program provides the best arrangement of the stops to 
minimze the total cost of operation, (Walk , ride and operating costs) .  
The routine was written by Maaza Christos Mekuria while in graduate school at Northeastern University.  
This work is an update of the original research tool. The update included ability to perform trip level analysis 
and optimization as well as use of geospatial data for all the street network, parcel and stop level data.  
A sqlite data storage is used for all inputs and the program writes also geographic data output into either 
an existing or new sqlite database.

The details of the optimization model is described in the dissertation document that maybe downloaded from 
https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:822/fulltext.pdf .  Working under Prof. Peter Furth, Maaza 
stumbled upon that the simple one dimensional optimization fails to be optimal as it could not handel the 
network curve effect from either the road network or the route geometry or both.  Hence the extended state-space 
model was deemed necessary and with help from some unknown researcher in Europe, Prof. Furth introduced Maaza 
to multi-state-space dynamic programming and the rest is history.
